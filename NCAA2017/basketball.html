Mad as a March Aardvark

<p>
Welcome to my Sweet 16 March Madness page.  This data is only relevant between March  19, 2017 and March 23, 2017.  At this point in time in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, there are 16 teams left.  I have calculated the results of all 32,768 possible outcomes and determine who is likely to win every bracket in which I am participating.
</p>
<p>
The links below are for each of three brackets.  Each link leads to a page listing possible winners, the number of possible outcomes that are still winners for that individual, and a list of teams that they should root for in the next round.
</p>
<p>
The next round game information is color coded as to how important a game is.  A square with a white background containing an asterisk indicates that exactly half of the winning combinations for an entry contain one team, and the other half contains the other.  A black square with white text indicates a MUST WIN game.  Any loss in any of those games will eliminate that entry.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the next round game squares will contain a team name and be color coded on a range from green (least important) to red (very important).  A hypothetical entry that has 1000 possible winning combinations may be down to 1 possible winning combination if a team marked in bright red loses.  All these games matter to some extent -- losing several greenish games could eliminate an entry as well.
</p>
<p>
When computing wins, I counted first place ties for all participants that tie as wins.  So the total number of winning combinations for all players probably exceeds 32,768 in most cases.
</p>
<p>
Also note that you may already be eliminated if a person has a higher score than you and also has enough remaining picks that match yours.  If you are not listed in any of these tables, it is quite likely that your best case scenario matches the best case scenario of another player who already has a higher score.
</p>
<p>
So, here are the brackets:
